** Automation testing 
The goal of this repo is to guide new aspiring learner who has little to no experience in the world of automation testing slowly.

My hope is that this effort will not be a standard run off the mill type of documentation or exercises, but, rather explain why we do things and how to adopt and learn the basics so that we build a strong foundation and innovate on that.
